## Why Choose Astro?

Astro offers several compelling advantages for modern web development:

- **Performance-focused**: Astro websites are exceptionally fast because they ship minimal JavaScript by default
- **Component-based**: Use components from your favorite UI frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- **Easy learning curve**: If you know HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, you can build with Astro
- **Flexible**: Works well for content-focused websites like blogs, marketing sites, and portfolios
- **Full-featured**: Built-in support for Markdown, MDX, file-based routing, and more
- **UI-agnostic**: Use components from React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit, and others

```javascript
// Example of an Astro component
---
// This is the component's frontmatter (runs at build time)
const greeting = "Hello, Astro!";
---

<!-- This is the component's template -->
<h1>{greeting}</h1>
<p>Welcome to your first Astro site!</p>
```

## Setting Up Your First Astro Project

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** - version 16.12.0 or higher
- **Text editor** - VS Code with the Astro extension is recommended
- **Terminal** - To run commands

### Creating a New Astro Project

The easiest way to create a new Astro project is to use the automatic CLI tool. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest

# Or with yarn
yarn create astro

# Or with pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest
```

Follow the CLI prompts to set up your project. You can choose from several starter templates or begin with a minimal setup.

### Project Structure

After initialization, your Astro project will have a structure similar to this:

```
├── public/
│   ├── favicon.svg
│   └── robots.txt
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Let's understand the key directories:

- **public/**: Static assets that will be copied to the build folder unchanged
- **src/components/**: Reusable UI components
- **src/layouts/**: Layout components that provide structure to your pages
- **src/pages/**: File-based routing - each .astro file becomes a route
- **astro.config.mjs**: Configuration file for your Astro project

### Running Your Project

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to your files will be reflected immediately thanks to hot module reloading.

## Creating Your First Page

In Astro, pages are created as `.astro` files in the `src/pages` directory. Let's create a simple page:

```astro
---
// src/pages/about.astro
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>About Us</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>This is our first Astro page!</p>
    <a href="/">Back to home</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

Save this file as `about.astro` in the `src/pages` directory, and you'll be able to access it at `http://localhost:3000/about`.

## Using Layouts

Writing the full HTML structure for each page can be repetitive. Astro provides layouts to solve this problem:

```astro
---
// src/layouts/MainLayout.astro
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>My Astro Site</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav>
      <a href="/">Home</a>
      <a href="/about">About</a>
    </nav>
    <main>
      <slot /> <!-- Your content will be inserted here -->
    </main>
    <footer>
      &copy; 2023 My Astro Site
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now you can simplify your pages by using this layout:

```astro
---
// src/pages/about.astro
import MainLayout from '../layouts/MainLayout.astro';
---

<MainLayout>
  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>This is our first Astro page using a layout!</p>
</MainLayout>
```
